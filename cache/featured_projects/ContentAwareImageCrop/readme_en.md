A content-aware image cropping tool based on the **Seam Carving** algorithm. It intelligently detects and removes the lowest-energy pixel paths (seams) from an image, reducing its dimensions while preserving the most visually significant regions.

## Features

- **Content-aware cropping**: Uses the Seam Carving algorithm to intelligently remove low-detail areas while preserving the visual subject.
- **Energy visualization**: Converts the energy distribution of an image into a grayscale map for inspection.
- **Real-time progress feedback**: Displays intermediate results with highlighted seams during the cropping process.
- **Seam highlighting**: Customizable highlight color and antialiasing options for visualizing each removed seam.
- **Undo / Redo**: Multi-step operation history for comparing cropping results.
- **Image size limit**: Optionally downscales large images to a specified size before processing to improve performance.
- **Multilingual UI**: Built-in Chinese and English interfaces, switchable at runtime.
- **Cross-version Qt support**: Compatible with both Qt 5 and Qt 6.

## Algorithm

The core steps of the Seam Carving algorithm are as follows:

1. **Energy computation**: Calculate an energy value for each pixel based on the gradient magnitude across RGB channels. Higher energy indicates richer local detail.
2. **Seam finding**: Use dynamic programming to find the minimum-energy path of pixels from top to bottom (or left to right), called a "seam".
3. **Seam removal**: Delete all pixels along the seam, reducing the image width (or height) by one pixel.
4. **Iteration**: Repeat until the target dimensions are reached.

$$
E(i,j) = \left|\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\right| + \left|\frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\right|

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Notes |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- |
| CMake | ≥ 3.17 | Build system |
| C++ Compiler | C++17 | MSVC / GCC / Clang |
| Qt | 5 or 6 | Widgets module required |

Third-party libraries (already bundled, no separate installation needed):

| Library | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) | Lightweight image loading (backend) |
| [easy_translate](frontend/3rdparty/easy_translate) | Lightweight i18n library (frontend) |

## Building

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaderoChan/ContentAwareImageCrop.git
cd ContentAwareImageCrop
```

### 2. Configure and build

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

> **Tip**: If both Qt 5 and Qt 6 are installed, specify the desired version via `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, e.g.:
>
> ```bash
> cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.x.x/msvc2019_64"
> ```

The executable is output to `build/frontend/bin/Release/` after a successful build.

### 3. Build the test program (optional)

```bash
cmake -B build -DBUILD_TEST=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

---

## Usage

1. Launch `ContentAwareImageCropFrontend.exe`.
2. Open an image via the menu or drag-and-drop.
3. Configure the cropping parameters:
   - **Crop amount**: Number of seams to remove, i.e., pixels to trim from the width (or height).
   - **Size limit**: When enabled, the image is pre-scaled to the specified size before processing (improves speed on large images).
   - **Highlight color**: Color used to visualize each removed seam.
   - **Antialiasing**: Enable antialiasing on the seam highlight overlay.
4. Click **Crop** to start processing and watch the real-time progress.
5. Use the undo / redo buttons to compare results at different stages.
6. Export the cropped image.
